# appium-boilerplate

Boilerplate project to run Appium tests together with WebdriverIO for:

- iOS/Android Native Apps
- iOS/Android Hybrid Apps
- Android Chrome and iOS Safari browser (see [TODO](./README.md##todo))

> This boilerplate uses the WebdriverIO native demo app which can be found [here](https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app).
> The releases can be found and downloaded [here](https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app/releases).

> Note:
> This boilerplate only handles local execution on 1 em/simulator at a time, not parallel execution. For more info about that Google on setting up a grid with Appium.

## Installing Appium on a local machine
See [Installing Appium on a local machine](./docs/APPIUM.md)

## Config
This boilerplate uses a specific config for iOS and Android, see [configs](./config/) and are based on `wdio.shared.conf.js`.
This shared config holds all the defaults so the iOS and Android configs only need to hold the capabilities that are needed for running on iOS and or Android.
